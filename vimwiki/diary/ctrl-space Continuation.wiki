Lists can be explained with a simple analogy. Let's imagine|Vim|is a
+------------+      +--------+        +-------+------------+---+    +------------------+
|writing desk|. Your|projects|are like|drawers---->projects   |. The|Bookmark List(<b>)|simply
+------------+      +--------+        +------------ -----------     +------------------+
             +-----------------+
displays your|favorite projects|
             +-----------------+
                                               +----------+
To get documents from a drawer you would need a|File List | It allows you
                                     +--------++----------+
to easily look up contents of a given|project | Once you locate and pick up
                   +------+
a file it becomes a|buffer|          +--------+
                   +------+
 +------+       +----------------+
A|buffer|is like|a sheet of paper|lying on the desk. Sometimes you can
 +------+       +----------------+
 
have a blank piece of paper – that's a new unsaved buffer. It would become

eventually a file on the disk once saved (put into a drawer). To manage
                                        +-----------+
all buffers on the desk you would need a|Buffer List|
                                        +-----------+
                                        
So far our analogy is fairly simple. This workflow is straightforward but
inefficient in the long run with a large amount of files. How could we
optimize it? +--------------+
             |              |
             |  IT IS Tabs  |
             |              |
             +--------------+
             
+------------------------------------+
|   With tabs you can, for example:  |
|                                    |
|    * group related buffers         |
|    * extract to other tabs         |
|    * name them accordingly         |
|    * move or copy them             |
|                                    |
+------------------------------------+

First, you need to select a project. Vim operates in a directory,
            +--------------------------------+
described as|`CWD` (Current Working Directory|. If you've just started a
            +--------------------------------+
MacVim it's probably pointing to your home directory (issue |:pwd| to

check it).
               +----------------------------------+
I advise you to|add a project to the Bookmark List|by opening the plugin
               +----------------------------------+
window (<C-Space>) and pressing <b>. The plugin will ask for a project
directory.


                          +------------------+
Make sure that the path is|not home directory| Otherwise the plugin will
                          +------------------+
start indexing all your files which will be pointless and resource
exhaustive. Be concrete and provide a real path to a project. Once your
bookmark is created, you can go there with <CR>.

What you are working now is in your project directory(current working directory)
(maybe sometimes different directory)

One window can have many buffers, the different windows has different tags , you can
switch the window(or tags) easyly with <l> under the visual window of the ctrlspace
In the end, you can take a picture what interface you end with , in order to restore the
interface next time quickly, you can use workspace
(use Enter to exit the search mode)


                                 +------------+
You can also "forget" a buffer by|pressing <f>| Forgetting means
                                 +------------+
detaching, making unrelated, or just making foreign to the given tab. Such
tab. Then it would only be available through the "All Mode" (press <a>).
buffer might be related to other tabs instead or might be unrelated to any
                                                               +-----+
                              +----+                           |     |
To see the Bookmark List press| <b>|. To add a bookmark - press| <a> |, to edit
                              +----+                           +-----+
the target directory - <e>. You can also rename it with <m> and <=>.


It's worth to mention, that you can still navigate to different places
manually, with the |:cd| command. The plugin will behave the same way.
In fact, jumping with Bookmark List is just like a shortcut for the |:cd|
command.




Cool Tip~

Another smart way of changing directory is jumping to a directory of given
                        +------+  +----------------+
buffer (file) by pressin|  <i> |in| the Buffer List|. It's useful if you have
                        +------+  +----------------+
                        
files from two or more different projects. To go (jump) back press  <I> .
