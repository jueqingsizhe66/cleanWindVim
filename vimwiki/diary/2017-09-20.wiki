    <Leader><      If standing on a delimiter (parenthesis or square bracket)
                   then moves it to the left by slurping or barfing the
                   s-expression to the left, depending on the direction of the
                   delimiter:
                   Pressing '<' when standing on a ')' makes the s-expression
                   to the left of the ')' going out of the current list.
                   Pressing '<' when standing on a '(' makes the s-expression
                   to the left of the '(' coming into the current list.
                   For example pressing <Leader>< at position marked with |:
                       (aaa bbb|)        --->    (aaa|) bbb
                       aaa |(bbb)        --->    |(aaa bbb)

    <Leader>>      If standing on a delimiter (parenthesis or square bracket)
                   then moves it to the right by slurping or barfing the
                   s-expression to the right, depending on the direction of the
                   delimiter:
                   Pressing '>' when standing on a '(' makes the s-expression
                   to the right of the '(' going out of the current list.
                   Pressing '>' when standing on a ')' makes the s-expression
                   to the right of the ')' coming into the current list.
                   For example pressing <Leader>< at position marked with |:
                       (aaa|) bbb        --->    (aaa bbb|)
                       |(aaa bbb)        --->    aaa |(bbb)


    <Leader><Up>   Splice the current list into the containing list by deleting
                   everything backward from the cursor position up to the
                   opening paren.
                   For example pressing <Leader><Up> at position marked with |:
                       (aaa (bbb |ccc) ddd)  --->    (aaa |ccc ddd)

    <Leader><Down> Splice the current list into the containing list by deleting
                   everything forward from the cursor position up to the
                   closing paren.
                   For example pressing <Leader><Down> at position marked with |:
                       (aaa (bbb| ccc) ddd)  --->    (aaa |bbb ddd)

    <Leader>I      Raise the current symbol, i.e. replace the current list with
                   the current symbol by deleting everything else (except the
                   symbol) in the list, including the enclosing pair of parens.
                   For example pressing <Leader>I at position marked with |:
                       (aaa (b|bb ccc) ddd)  --->    (aaa |bbb ddd)
