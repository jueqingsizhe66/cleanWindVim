Gnu org 官网

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and project planning with a fast and 
effective plain-text system. It also is an authoring system with unique support for literate 
programming and reproducible research.

包括四个主要功能

+ keeping notes
+ maintaining TODO lists(vimwiki 和org todo 类似)
+ project planning
+ fast and effective plain-text
+ literate programming and reproducible research



== outliner ==

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the content
of large files well structured.(Structure edit style)
(Outlines allow a document to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least for me) 
is the best representation of notes  and thoughts)

An overview of this structure is achieved by folding(hiding) large parts of the document
to show only the gentle document structure and the parts currently being worked on.

== tables ==

Tables are easily created with a built-in table editor(table的产生)
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites,emails, USEnet messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects

== outputs ==

Org files can serve as a single source authoring system with export to many
different formats such as HTML, Latex, Open Document, and Markdown

== source code blocks ==
Org files can include source code blocks, which makes Org uniquely suited for authoring
techniques documents with code examples(带code快的文档比较技术性？)
Org source code blocks are fully functional; they can be evaluated in place and
their results can be captured in the file(这时区分markdown 和vimwiki的地方), this makes
it possible to create a single file reproducible research compendium

== simple and clear ==
Org is a toolbox(many tools), org keeps simple things simple. When first fired up, it should
feel like a straightforward, easy to use outliner. Complexity is not imposed, but a large amount of
functionality is available when needed.
