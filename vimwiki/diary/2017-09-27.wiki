== Idle timer ==

This snippet is from John Wiegley - http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2010-03/msg00367.html. It shows the org agenda when Emacs is idle.

Thanks to winner-mode, I can get back to my previous buffers with C-c left.

(defun jump-to-org-agenda ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((buf (get-buffer "*Org Agenda*"))
        wind)
    (if buf
        (if (setq wind (get-buffer-window buf))
            (select-window wind)
          (if (called-interactively-p)
              (progn
                (select-window (display-buffer buf t t))
                (org-fit-window-to-buffer)
                ;; (org-agenda-redo)
                )
            (with-selected-window (display-buffer buf)
              (org-fit-window-to-buffer)
              ;; (org-agenda-redo)
              )))
      (call-interactively 'org-agenda-list)))
  ;;(let ((buf (get-buffer "*Calendar*")))
  ;;  (unless (get-buffer-window buf)
  ;;    (org-agenda-goto-calendar)))
  )

(run-with-idle-timer 300 t 'jump-to-org-agenda)


== Strike through DONE headlines ==

I wanted a quick way to visually distinguish DONE tasks from tasks I still need to do. This handy snippet from the Emacs Org-mode mailing list does the trick by striking through the headlines for DONE tasks.

(setq org-fontify-done-headline t)
(custom-set-faces
 '(org-done ((t (:foreground "PaleGreen"
                 :weight normal
                 :strike-through t))))
 '(org-headline-done
            ((((class color) (min-colors 16) (background dark))
               (:foreground "LightSalmon" :strike-through t)))))
