This plugin is meant to simplify a task I've found too common in my workflow: switching between a single-line statement and a multi-line one. It offers the following default keybindings, which can be customized:

    gS to split a one-liner into multiple lines
    gJ (with the cursor on the first line of a block) to join a block into a single-line statement.

you can use it into map-reduce  ,if ,for ,while etc
